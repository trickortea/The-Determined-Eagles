• A heat map of the police districts or beats in Chicago showing the complaint to discipline 
ratio that allows you to filter out districts based on demographics and wealth. 
• A star chart with the number of previous officer disciplines on the outside and racial 
demographics on the inside showing the likelihood that a certain officer is to have a 
misconduct allegation against them based on the race of the person complaining and the 
number of disciplinary actions they have received. The interactive portion could be that 
you can toggle between number of disciplines or number of misconduct allegations.
