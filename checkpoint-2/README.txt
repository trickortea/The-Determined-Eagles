Checkpoint 2:
Questions/Visualizations:
•	A text table comparing number of sustained and not sustained allegations, organized by neighborhoods, and broken down by race of the person filing the misconduct allegation. 
•	Stacked bar chart with each bar being a category of misconduct complaint and each bar showing the percentage that were disciplined. 
Code is on a Tableau Work Book and the first table is filtered by 
COUNT(FINAL FOUNDING)>1500 to limit the amount of data visible to a 
reasonable level.
