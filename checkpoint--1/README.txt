Each file is for a single question. I ran them in datagrip and
examined the output there. The outputs were all tables with labels that 
are further explained in the analysis but are pretty easy to understand. 

Questions to Answer:

q1: What percentage of officers get disciplined for misconduct given 
the number of previous disciplines they have received?

q2: Given the number of previous misconduct disciplines, 
what are the number of misconduct allegations sustained?

q3: What categories of misconduct allegations are more likely to 
result in disciplinary action?

q4: Are senior officers more likely to escape disciplinary action?
